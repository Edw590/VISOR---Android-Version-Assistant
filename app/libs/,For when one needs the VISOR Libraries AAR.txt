If you need the VISOR Libraries AAR package, you need to compile them from 
source from this repository: https://github.com/Edw590/VISOR---A-Voice-Assistant.

The reason is that I kept updating them every now and then, and currently the 
repository has 1+ GB, which is ridiculous for at least this app. So I removed 
the file and now whoever wants the library has to compile it from source.
