	 * of call states already taking place stored in {@link #calls_state}, this function attempts to understand what
	 * the new CALL_STATE_x means. For example, if OFFHOOK is received, in case there was no call taking place, then it
	 * means it's an outgoing call; but if a call was in its RINGING state and now is on OFFHOOK, that means an incoming
	 * call was just accepted.</p>
	 * <br>
	 * <p>Note: there are constants ending in "_LATE". Those are so because they're only detected after the end of all
	 * calls are over and after the phone gets to IDLE state. Which means, they already happened some time ago (1 second,
	 * 10 minutes, unpredictable).</p>
